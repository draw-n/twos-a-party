# Two's a Party, Three's a Crowd

## Description
A single-player platform game filled with fun puzzles and cute graphics! This game was created for the Technology Student Association (TSA) Competition for the 2022-2023 school year. It features three levels, with three controllable characters. However, the player is only permitted to control two at one time (mechanic derived from the title of the game). This restriction allows the player to think critically about their next movements.
